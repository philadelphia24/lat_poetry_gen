Renaissance writers have been fascinated by ancient traditions in writing for a long time and pursued a path to revive an ancient world of creative writing. This project followed a similar goal, not by taking up a pen and paper, but by teaching Latin to a computer. It presents VIRGO-1, an early-stage poetry generation system (PGS) designed to produce Latin poems from prosaic input. In total, eleven models were trained: five trained on a 10 million-word corpus, five others on the 22.5 million-word version, and lastly, one trained on 290,000 words of poetry data for comparative analysis. While the system shows initial potential, it faces several challenges, particularly in generating coherent and metrically accurate poetry. Despite these hurdles, the system lays a promising foundation for future research, offering insights into a constraint-based approach using prose input and a self-created dictionary for various sizes of vocabularies and two corpus sizes. This work also produced three cleaned datasets and an unduplicated 140 million-word version of the Corpus Corporum, which can support further advancements in Latin poetry generation. I also carried out an online expert validation with 26 Latin experts from Belgium and Germany, which can provide useful pointers for future developments.
